# PHP Coding Standards

This is a "fork" of the WP PHP Coding Standards document, to add clarifications and remove ambiguities.

The aim is to have a location for community contributions to improve the current [PHP Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/) page for WordPress.

While some minor syntax fixes and clarifications should be added, the aim is to "plug the holes", for PHP 5.3+ features such as namespaces, `use` statements, interfaces, traits, strict types declarations, that are already in use within the community of plugin and theme developers.

See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/GaryJones/303d8b9ebb2d6a5bb800) for a starting point.
